        <p class="texto">Rodrigo Torres de la Garza, better known as Nsqk, born in Monterrey, Nuevo León (Mexico) and raised in Houston, Texas (United States of America) is a producer and singer who mixes notes from the Pop, Rap, R&B, Rock and EDM genres to create music with the intention of breaking genre and theme barriers. He is co-founder and member of the Monterrey collective No Pedí Permiso, is part of the pop-urban music duo Southboys and more recently, he began his solo career. On January 31, 2020, he released his debut EP Botánica, a brutally honest work that talks about the ups and downs of a romantic relationship and the feelings that these imply; such as jealousy, anger, love, sadness and the power to accept that one feels vulnerable.</p>
